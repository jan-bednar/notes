# Description

Notes! Thats basicly it!

When you launch the application, you will see a list of your notes. You can tap on any note to read it, edit it. If you want to delete it, just swipe on the note and delete button will appear.

If you want to cretate new note, tap the add button on the action bar.

# Code description

App is using Coordinator approach with Apple MVC pattern. The view controllers are small already, therefore I did not have a need to complicate is more with different patterns. The components of the application are reusable and could be refactored to use other design pattern.

If you have any question or suggestion, create an issue in this github repo please!

# Users bevare

The application is currently using mock server, responses from the server are not adjusted to the request, therefore when you create a note, you will get a different one from the server. (Well, if you need to buy some bread and cheese for breakfast, then you have a chance of getting right response)
